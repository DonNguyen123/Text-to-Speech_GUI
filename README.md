Hello,

The code provided is essentually is a GUI of a vits model from the python TTS libary. To get the code, which may be unusually large, please use this google link (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KZ6q2xyNh0x1msT0dN4yzUv3585HxdU3?usp=drive_link), to find and download the zip file required. The file "TTS GUI Code.zip" contains the origional code in case you wish to run it directly in python. If you wish to have an executable to run instead, please download "TTS GUI Version A.zip", unzip it, and click the exe file. Note that for some the executable version may be falsely flagged in some antivirus software. Reguardless of which method used, you should get the first image shown below when you run the program:

From here, you should choose the voice you want in the "Voice Setting" section. Note that in theory that there about 109 voices that have been manually sorted between male and female. Note that further details of the voices based on the orgional libary are difficult to determine (see https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS/issues/2258):

Then, after you have chosen a voice, please enter the text you want the software to say in the "Enter Text" box:

Afterwards, please drag the blue bars to the wanted volumn and pitch in the "Control" section. Note that you may have to switch around voices to "set" to the new setting inputted:

Then, you have the option to preview the text being spoken, stop the text from being spoken, or save the speach as a mp3 file in the same "Control section. Note that depending on the amount of text spoken, it may take a long while for the code to process, or freeze as the scripts run in the background. For location of the options and the example resulting mp3 file, please see below:
